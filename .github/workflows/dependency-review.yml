            ### Tips:
            - Keep dependencies up to date for security patches
            - Consider bundle size impact
            - Review licenses for new dependencies
            - Use \`bun outdated\` to check for updates
            
            ### Useful Commands:
            \`\`\`bash
            # Check outdated packages
            bun outdated
            
            # Update packages
            bun update
            
            # Check bundle size
            du -sh node_modules
            \`\`\``;
